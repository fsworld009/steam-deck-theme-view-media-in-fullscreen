/* Without this patch, the theme won't work until about 10 seconds after user
 * enters Media page.
 *
 * The reason being this particular div has
 * `topleveltransitionswitch_EnterActive_Cpk9b` class. This class sets
 * `transform: scale(1)`, which breaks the patch.
 * 
 * This div would eventually loses topleveltransitionswitch_Enter_d8bGj
 * and topleveltransitionswitch_EnterActive_Cpk9b classes after about 10
 * seconds, so this patch isn't necessary.
 *
 * Making this patch optional since this applies to a global div and I'm not
 * sure if this would break other pages.
